# Davidson College Library Omeka S Repository

## Davidson College Library Context

Davidson College Library added Omeka S to the suite of technologies for digital scholarship and archives & special collections. This repository will hold internal documentation (day-to-day operations, one-time projects), code snippets (PHP, CSS, HTML), and external documentation that we've found helpful (both official Omeka S and the greater Omeka S community).
