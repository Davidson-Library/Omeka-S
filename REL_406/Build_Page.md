#### Details for Adding Content to Pages

Now that the page has been created under the site, you can start adding content to mirror the original HTML/WP site. Below are two screenshots to provide an overview snapshot, including **HTML Blocks** and **Media Embed Blocks**

### How to Build Pages

Add Blocks to each Omeka S page, e.g., HTML and Media Embed to mirror the structure of original HTML site

#### Copy Text to HTML Blocks

Copy the text from the HTML/WP site, either in the HTML view or public view. **Add new HTML block** and **paste** the text/code. If there's a heading, use **Heading 3** `<h3>` since `<h1>` (site title) and `<h2>` (page title) are already used.

#### Save and View each page for consistency and accessibility

**Click Save** then **View** to see what the public view looks like. You may need to adjust the alignment, but **medium** and **left/right** for the media embed seems to do best as "center" doesn't look all that great.

Run a [WAVE test](https://wave.webaim.org/) to check for missing alt text, or other accessibility errors. If you have 0 errors, "check mark" the appropriate columns in the GSheet tracker.
